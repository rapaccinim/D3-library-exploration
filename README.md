# D3 Library Exploration
Here is a repo about some cool stuff while coding with D3 library

## What is D3
[D3](https://d3js.org/) (Data-Driven Documents) is an interesting JavaScript library that allows you to bind data to a DOM (Document Object Model) and apply transformations to it.

## Why use D3
D3 is a powerful JS library that can be used to draw charts, graphs, treemaps, interactive plots, etc. [Here](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery) you can find a lot of good examples.

## My goal
I started studying D3 because one of the project I'm working on requires an excellent and flexible library for rendering custom hierarchical trees/graphs and the [Cytoscape](https://js.cytoscape.org/) library is simple but limited.

So, D3 is a more complex but far more advanced library to finally develop high-customized graphs.
